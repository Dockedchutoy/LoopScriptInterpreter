# LoopScript Interpreter

This is a simple AST interpreter for the esolang LoopScript. It supports all instructions defined.

If the interpreter is provided with a file path as an argument, it will attempt to execute the file.
Otherwise, a simple REPL can be used.

The samples folder has most of the examples from the wiki article, so you can play around with those.
